# Slytherin snake
## A Game Time Project (FE - Module 2)

Recreate the classic game Snake using Object Oriented Programming. 

### [Play here](https://tdberg21.github.io/game-time/ "play here")

## Goals

* [X] Use OOP to drive the design of the game and the code

* [X] Separate business-logic code from view-related code

* [X] Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application


## Playability Features

* [X] Indicate when the game is over and won or lost

* [X] Allow the user to start a new game

* [X] Display a score (if applicable)

* [X] Include a clean UI surrounding the actual game interface itself (this might include instructions on how to play, a high score saved in localStorage, etc. Think of what would be most intuitive for your particular game.)
